#summary Create Database Session


== Session Factory ==

The session factory is the entry point to obtain a database session.

{{{
with ADO.Sessions;
with ADO.Sessions.Factory;
   ...
   Sess_Factory : ADO.Sessions.Factory.Session_Factory;
}}}

== Factory Initialization ==

The factory can be initialized by giving a URI string that identifies the
driver and the information to connect to the database.

{{{
   ADO.Sessions.Factory.Create (Sess_Factory, "mysql://localhost:3306/ado_test?user=test");
}}}

== Opening a Session ==

The session is created by using the `Get_Session` function of the factory.
The session is associated with a database connection.

{{{
   S : ADO.Sessions.Session := Sess_Factory.Get_Session;
}}}
